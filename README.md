# INDUS An AI E-Commerce Web Innovation
 In this project artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are applied innovatively to an ecommerce website introducing a new perspective to online shopping with artificial agents. This project presents an aspect of negotiating and bargaining online and features a bargain-based e-commerce website, where chatbot act as a shopkeeper and can negotiate the price of the product with a customer and a content-based recommendation system that recommends similar products based on product attributes and description rather than on likings and ratings of customer. The chatbot is developed using deep learning algorithms combined with the natural language processing techniques and recommendation system is developed using natural language processing algorithms. This project is implemented using modern tools and technologies Python, Flask and Machine learning libraries Scikit-Learn and Keras.
